# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a one-click international payment application that simplifies cross-border money transfers using blockchain technology. The app will handle the complete payment flow from fiat on-ramping to stable coin transfer to fiat off-ramping, while providing users with a simple interface that only requires basic payment information. The system will integrate with Fern for fiat conversion, PYUSD as the stable coin, and ENS for user-friendly wallet addressing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sender, I want to initiate an international payment with minimal input, so that I can quickly send money across borders without dealing with complex blockchain operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the payment interface THEN the system SHALL display input fields for amount, recipient wallet address, and payment confirmation
2. WHEN a user enters a payment amount THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate and display estimated fees and transfer time
3. WHEN a user submits a payment request THEN the system SHALL handle on-ramping, stable coin conversion, transfer, and off-ramping automatically in the background
4. WHEN the payment process completes THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and update the transaction history

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a sender, I want to see transparent fee estimates and transfer times upfront, so that I can make informed decisions about my payments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a payment amount THEN the system SHALL display real-time fee estimates including on-ramp, blockchain, and off-ramp fees
2. WHEN fee calculations are updated THEN the system SHALL show the breakdown of each fee component
3. WHEN a user views transfer time estimates THEN the system SHALL display expected completion time based on current network conditions
4. IF network conditions change significantly THEN the system SHALL update estimates automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sender, I want to use ENS names instead of complex wallet addresses, so that I can easily identify and send money to merchants and contacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an ENS name in the recipient field THEN the system SHALL resolve it to the corresponding wallet address
2. WHEN an ENS name is successfully resolved THEN the system SHALL display both the ENS name and resolved address for confirmation
3. IF an ENS name cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow manual wallet address entry
4. WHEN a user enters a raw wallet address THEN the system SHALL validate the address format and accept valid addresses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my complete transaction history, so that I can track all my international payments and their statuses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses transaction history THEN the system SHALL display all past transactions with timestamps, amounts, recipients, and statuses
2. WHEN a transaction is in progress THEN the system SHALL show real-time status updates including current processing stage
3. WHEN a user selects a specific transaction THEN the system SHALL display detailed information including fees paid and transaction hashes
4. WHEN transactions are loaded THEN the system SHALL sort them by date with most recent first

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have an intuitive and visually appealing interface with smooth animations, so that the payment process feels modern and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations for state transitions and loading states
2. WHEN payment processing occurs THEN the system SHALL display animated progress indicators showing the current stage
3. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through animations and micro-interactions
4. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL present a clean, modern design that builds user confidence

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to integrate with Fern for fiat on/off-ramping, so that users can seamlessly convert between fiat and cryptocurrency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a payment is initiated THEN the system SHALL use Fern API to convert user's fiat currency to PYUSD
2. WHEN PYUSD reaches the recipient THEN the system SHALL use Fern API to convert PYUSD back to recipient's local fiat currency
3. IF Fern integration is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and fallback options
4. WHEN fiat conversion occurs THEN the system SHALL handle all KYC and compliance requirements through Fern's services

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my payments to use PYUSD stable coin for transfers, so that I can benefit from stable value and fast blockchain transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fiat is converted to cryptocurrency THEN the system SHALL use PYUSD as the stable coin for all transfers
2. WHEN PYUSD transfers occur THEN the system SHALL use appropriate blockchain networks for optimal speed and cost
3. WHEN displaying transaction details THEN the system SHALL show PYUSD amounts alongside fiat equivalents
4. IF PYUSD is unavailable THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide alternative stable coin options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement smart contracts for secure and automated payment processing, so that transfers are trustless and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payments are processed THEN the system SHALL use smart contracts to handle PYUSD transfers securely
2. WHEN smart contracts execute THEN the system SHALL ensure atomic transactions that either complete fully or revert entirely
3. WHEN contract interactions occur THEN the system SHALL handle gas fee optimization automatically
4. WHEN contracts are deployed THEN the system SHALL include proper access controls and security measures

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement mock services for initial development, so that the app can be tested and demonstrated without requiring full third-party integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs in development mode THEN the system SHALL use mock Fern API responses for on/off-ramping
2. WHEN mock services are active THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic delays and responses for testing
3. WHEN switching between mock and live services THEN the system SHALL use configuration flags to control integration modes
4. WHEN mock transactions complete THEN the system SHALL generate realistic transaction data for testing purposes
