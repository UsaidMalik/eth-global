## Problem Statement

International payments are hard to do due to fees and conversion rates across boundaries. An international student would have to convert their money to the receiving countries currency and then send it like that. What if they could buy a stable coin and then send the money like that ? Would that be cheaper than international exchanges and funds 

## Proposed Solutions

 A platform that allows single click payments (no KYC?) by routing payments across some blockchain with the lowest fees and best transaction rates circumventing the  international systems (this kind of just sounds like crypto transactions with extra steps)
